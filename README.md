# Automated-Parking-System-using-ML
The Automated Parking System project you're describing is designed to streamline the parking process using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly focusing on image recognition to identify car license plates. The system aims to automate the allocation of parking spots by detecting car numbers through captured images.
Overview
Project Title: Automated Parking System Using Machine Learning
Primary Goal: To efficiently allocate parking spots in a parking facility using image recognition technology.
Technology Stack: Machine Learning, Image Processing, possibly Python for scripting, and libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and a machine learning framework for model training.
Core Functionality
Image Capture: The system captures images of cars as they enter the parking area.
License Plate Recognition: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to detect and read license plate numbers from the captured images.
Spot Allocation: Based on the recognized license plate, the system assigns an available parking spot to the vehicle.
Database Integration: Stores car numbers and allocated spot details in a database for management and retrieval.
Machine Learning Aspect
Model Training: The system employs a trained ML model to recognize and interpret car numbers from various angles and lighting conditions.
Accuracy Improvement: The current model accuracy stands at 81 out of 100, indicating the model correctly identifies the car number 81% of the time. The objective is to enhance this accuracy rate through further training and optimization.
Current Status and Goals
Current Accuracy: 81% success rate in accurately detecting car numbers.
Improvement Strategies: Include expanding the training dataset, applying more sophisticated image preprocessing techniques, experimenting with different ML algorithms, and fine-tuning the model parameters.
Challenges and Considerations
Image Quality: Ensuring high-quality image capture is crucial for accurate recognition, which can be influenced by factors like camera resolution, angle, and external conditions (e.g., lighting, weather).
Diverse License Plates: Handling a wide variety of license plate designs and formats.
Real-Time Processing: The system should be capable of processing images and allocating spots in real-time to prevent bottlenecks.
Scalability and Reliability: Ensuring the system can handle a high volume of vehicles and maintain consistent performance.
Potential Impact
Efficiency: Reduces the time and effort required for drivers to find a parking spot.
Space Optimization: Maximizes the use of available parking space.
Data Collection: Offers valuable data insights on parking patterns and vehicle flow.
This Automated Parking System represents a blend of practical utility and technological innovation, showcasing how machine learning can be applied to everyday challenges. The focus on improving the accuracy of image detection is not only crucial for the system's effectiveness but also contributes to the broader field of image recognition in ML.
