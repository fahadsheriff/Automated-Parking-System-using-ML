# Automated-Parking-System-using-ML
The Automated Parking System project you're describing is designed to streamline the parking process using Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly focusing on image recognition to identify car license plates. The system aims to automate the allocation of parking spots by detecting car numbers through captured images.


Project Title: Automated Parking System Using Machine Learning


Primary Goal: To efficiently allocate parking spots in a parking facility using image recognition technology.
Technology Stack: Machine Learning, Image Processing, possibly Python for scripting, and libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and a machine learning framework for model training.
